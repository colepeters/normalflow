      "date": "2022-08-12T00:00:00.000Z",
      "excerpt": "Effective designs optimize for constraints. These constraints are not just useful, they are critical: a beautiful building not designed for the constraints of tectonic movement and climate variability will collapse, and products not designed for the myriad constraints of the web will never amass a critical user base. Furthermore, a design system without adequate constraints will quickly grow into a disordered mess, especially as more contributors join in and more design problems are encountered."
