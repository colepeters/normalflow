Some things I’ve learned over the course of my life and career in regards to building systems (design, web, software, interpersonal, whatever), which may or may not be applicable to everyone:

- Create meaning and value for humans — not cliques, or corporations.
- Build and communicate with compassion.
- Consider the people your actions advantage and disadvantage.
- Accept that you cannot reach or please everyone. Scale is not always an arbiter of success.
- There are no simple solutions to complex problems.
- Bring a healthy scepticism to pithy advice bandied about by people who haven’t faced or solved the challenges you’re facing.

This list is nonexhaustive.
